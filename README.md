# LightBnB
## A Lighthouse Labs bootcamp exercise

We'll be creating an application to revolutionize the travel industry.  

* We will start by designing the database and creating an ERD for the tables.  
* Then we will create the database and the tables using the ERD.  
* We will add some fake data to the database to make testing queries easier.  
* Then we will start writing queries.  
* Finally, we will connect the database to a javascript application so that we can interact with the data from a web page.
